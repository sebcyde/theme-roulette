# Theme Roulette README

## Features

Theme Roulette is built for devs that frequently change their VS Code themes. Using the 'Spin Roulette' command, the extension will automatically change your theme on a timer until the 'Stop Roulette' command is run.

The amount of minutes between cycles can be set in the extension settings. The default is 15 minutes.

## Dependencies

This extension is an addition to the Doki Theme library and is built to randomly cycle through the themes that that library provides. As such this extension won't work unless you also have the Doki theme extension installed.
