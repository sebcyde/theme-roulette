# Theme Roulette README

## Features

Theme Roulette is built for devs that frequently change their VS Code themes. Using the 'Spin Roulette' command, the extension will automatically change your theme every 30 minutes until the 'Stop Roulette' command is run.

## Dependencies

This extension is an addition to the Doki Theme library and is built to randomly cycle through the themes that that library provides. As such this extension won't work unless you also have the Doki theme extension installed.
